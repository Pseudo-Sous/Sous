# Sous
Sous operates along side Chef and Python much the same a sous-chef would
the executive chef and the rest of the kitchen. In order words, Sous 
implements the overall principles of Chef while managing the details.

### Chef vs Sous
Chef was an esoteric programming language developed by David Morgan-Mar.
The goal of the language was to produce programs that not only look like
cooking recipes, but also are cooking recipes. While it is possible to
write simple programs in Chef, the language lacks a number of features
taken for granted in today's languages. As such, Sous was created to 
allow for more complex programs while still holding true to Chef's
principles.
